## Project plan

### Project description

DEAFinitley Digital will support the Deaf Community to develop and advance their digital skills. We will have equipment available for the Deaf community to use during informal drop in sessions and will help the community to access and embrace modern digital tools. Our outcomes are improved access to free, accessible and culturally sensitive digital training and experience, increased confidence and reduced isolation for the Deaf community.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1

Identify and purchase required hardware & software. Install setup/training server and clients.

Phase 1 Project Update: 

Our project has had an interesting time since it started. We have successfully installed our new Wireless Access Point, providing improved WiFi access to our lounge/café area and purchased a Microsoft Multipoint server which allows many users to connect to one machine using a common set of applications. This allowed the server administrator to control the desktop of each user and reduces licence costs. 

For user connection we decided to use 4 x HP 410 Thin Clients, these are all in one units, which professed to offer excellent multi media performance. All went well for the server installation and the thin client seemed to work well right up until we tried to run a YouTube video at which point the picture stuttered and the sound became out of sync. YouTube and resources such as the BBC iPlayer are vital  to our work because they allow us to access BSL translated material on demand, they are crucial to the work we do digitally.

I contacted HP support to see if I had done something wrong during the install that would impair performance and was surprised to get a response that said the 410 wouldn’t be able to cope with YouTube or the iPlayer, in fact it would struggle to run MS Office! Not exactly the excellent multi media performance we had been led to expect and a response that does beg the question “What can it run?”. 

HP recommended moving to the next model up, the 510, our supplier was happy to do this but there would be a re-stock charge for the 410 units of £25 each. This seemed unfair given that the publicity for the 410 claimed it was built for exactly the kind of thing we hoped to use it for.

It was then that we discovered HP have a feedback section on their website, they claim this is read by the UK CEO, so we outlined the whole sorry tale and fair play to them within an hour they had offered to buy back the 410s at no cost to us.
However all of this has taken time and we are now behind in our schedule.

During this time it was also decided that to relocate our classroom area to a bigger space, this area has recently had its cabling checked and is being decorated. The classroom area will be up and running in July.

We have started to publicise this project and with the introduction of the new Next Generation Text Relay, which provides text relay from PC, mobile and tablet, we anticipate that we will be very busy from when we open.
Fingers crossed our next three months run smoother than the past three.


### Our New WAP is in providing improved internet access to our lounge and cafe.

## Evaluation

We have hit something of a snag! We have bought an HP server and 4 HP T410 thin clients, the idea being that buying from the one vendor will avoid any compatibility issues. The data sheet on the HP website says the T410 gives "PC-like performance" and the "highest quality multimedia performance" which sounded exactly what we needed.
Installation of the server went very well, no great issues at all. The T410 thin client linked up seamlessly, but running a video, from either the iPlayer or Youtube, was a disaster.
A bit of an issue for a Deaf organisation that uses a lot of BSL videos.
We contacted HP and this was their official responce: "due to a hardware limitation and HP R&D can not provide any fix or improvement of the performance with t410 using application such as youtube, excel, Internet Explorer, MS office etc."
In other words this client won't run anything!
We are now looking at different thin clients and will post pictures when we have everything up and running.
For now we're more than disappointed.
